# git-open.nvim

ðŸš€ **A Neovim plugin to open your current file in the browser on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.**

Jump from your editor to your repository's web interface with a single keystroke. Perfect for code reviews, sharing links, or viewing files in context.

**git-open.nvim** focuses on solving a specific problem really well:

âœ… What We Do Best

1. Dual Context Awareness - Distinguish between upstream main and current branch
2. Multi-Platform Support - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and custom Git hosts work out of the box
3. Minimal Setup - Zero configuration required to get started

ðŸ¤” Honest Comparison
While other plugins may have overlapping features, git-open.nvim is designed specifically for developers who:

- Need both upstream and current branch contexts regularly
- Work across multiple Git hosting platforms
- Want a lightweight solution without heavy dependencies
- Prefer simple keybinds over complex commands

## âœ¨ Why

I didn't manage to configure any other plugin to work how I would like it to.
